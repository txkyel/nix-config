# txkyel's flakes

## TODOs:

I want to improve robustness of my config and reduce general evaluation times.

To that end, I'd like to reduce my desktop dependencies to as few flakes as possible to
reduce potential sources of errors.

- Investigate alternatives to home-manager to speed up evaluation times
- Find alternative to swaync (potentially also Astal/AGS?)
- Create own nvim config without nvf abstraction layer
