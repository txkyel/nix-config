# AGS/Astal Config

I plan on building a bar to step away from using the waybar configuration I originally took from JaKooLit.
The eventual goal is to build widgets to my custom spec without having to rely on further external frameworks.


## Bar TODOs

- Clock
  - Clicking on clock opens a calendar widget
  - Clicking on clock opens a menu containing calendar and notification center
- SysTray
  - Left click opens associated GUI app if it exists
  - Right click opens context menu
- Menu button
  - Click on menu button toggles rofi
