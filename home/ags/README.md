# AGS/Astal Config

I plan on building a bar to step away from using the waybar configuration I originally took from JaKooLit.
The eventual goal is to build widgets to my custom spec without having to rely on further external frameworks.


## Bar TODOs

- [x] Clock
  - [x] Clicking on clock opens a calendar widget
  - [ ] Clicking on clock opens a menu containing calendar and notification center
- [x] SysTray
  - [x] Left click opens associated GUI app if it exists
  - [x] Right click opens context menu
  - [ ] Add cohesive icon overrides
- [ ] Menu button
  - [ ] Click on menu button toggles rofi
- [ ] Add resource utilization (potentially in a context menu?)
